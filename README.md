## 📦 Requirements
- Xiaomi smartphone with a **Snapdragon** chipset
- **Unlocked bootloader** (mandatory)

## 🚀 Installation

### 🔧 Method 1: Fastboot (PC)
1. Go to the [Releases](../../releases) tab and download your desired **`...-logo.img`** file.  
   Each `...-logo.img` contains a different custom splash image — pick the one you like.
3. Reboot your device into **Fastboot mode**:
   - Power off your phone  
   - Hold **Volume Down + Power**
4. Connect the phone to your PC via USB.
5. On your PC, navigate to your **platform-tools** folder.
6. Open a terminal (or CMD) in that folder.
7. Run the following command:

```bash
fastboot flash logo <path-to-your-custom-logo.img>
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Replace `<path-to-your-custom-logo.img>` with the actual path to the `.img` file you downloaded from Releases. Or you can just drag & drop the `.img` into the terminal window.

7. Wait for the flash to complete.
8. Type `fastboot reboot` or manually reboot the phone.
9. Enjoy your new custom splash screen.

### 🔧 Method 2: Custom Recovery (Phone Only)
1. Download the desired **flashable ZIP** from the [Releases](../../releases) tab directly to your device.
2. Reboot into custom recovery (TWRP, OrangeFox, or PitchBlack).
3. Locate the ZIP file in your file browser within recovery.
4. Flash the ZIP.
5. Reboot your device.
6. Done — new bootlogo should be in place.
